Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a branch of computer science for developing and maintaining software.
A software is expected to be
Scalable and flexible: it can handle increased load smoothly without affecting the performance. 
Secure- a software ought to implement protection measures like authentication and encryption to safeguard user information.
Efficient- developers workflow should be maintained not loosing the need for high quality standards
Reliable- a oftware should be able to function as intended without fail


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering process
Mastering complexity
Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- here you identify the scope and the purpose or the problem being solved and the required to bring the software to life
Requirement analysis - you identify the specification of the final user
Design -The actual worrk of building a framework for the software
Coding - writing a tangible code for the software design
Testing - assessing if software works as per the intention without bugs and glitches.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall methodology Linear and sequential, every stage is finished before going on to the next as changes are difficult to implement when a phase is over, and there is little flexibility.Feedback from customers is received after the product has been developed then testing is done. while
agile approach It is progressive and iterative, involving several sprints, high degree of adaptability to shifting needs and every sprint incorporates regular customer input.Continuous testing is carried out following each iteration.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer develops application and sytems using programming languages and frameworks, collaborates with otaem members to ensure the optimal practice when devloping software also maintain and updates software to keep it functional.
A quality assurance engineer on the other hand collaborates with the relevant stakehlders to understand the softwarerequiremnts in order create development standards and procedures,confirm that the software meets the rquirements before deployment and analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make the more efficient.
A project manager assembles and leads the software development team in discussing the project and it's requirement with thw client and software developers, creates blueprint, tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone and deliverr the complete software to the client.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code. eg **Visual studio code.**
**importance**
  There are specifications for the structure of statements in programming languages. An IDE has numerous clever tools for automatically writing or changing the source code because it is aware of these guidelines.
  The typed text can be formatted by an IDE by utilizing different font colors or automatically bolding or italicizing certain terms. These visual indications provide immediate feedback regarding inadvertent syntax problems and improve the readability of the source code.
  As soon as the developer starts typing, an IDE can offer ideas for finishing a code statement.
  By carrying out repeated development chores that are usually included in every code change, IDEs help programmers become more productive.
 
Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg **Git**
  importance
  Enhanced collaboration as several developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts
  Helps in tracking changes in the project as it records detailed history of changes allowing easy analysis of each modification.
  Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
  Error Recovery as it allows rolling back to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Time Constrainst
  solution: integrate agile methodologies eg scrum to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into smaller managable sprints.
Limited infrastructure
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively
Changing Software Requirements
solution: Engineers can use methods like modular design, which allows for flexibility by dividing systems into manageable, separate components, and agile development, which stresses iterative progress and adaptation.
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
Helps verify whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
importance of prompt engineering
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.
Better user experience: Users can easily find pertinent results in the first prompt thanks to prompt engineering. It assists in reducing potential bias resulting from preexisting human bias in the training data for big language models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
**Vague Prompt:**  
"Write about technology."  

**Improved Prompt:**  
*"Write a 500-word article about how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, including its benefits, challenges, and future potential."*  

### **Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:**  
1. **Specific Topic** – Instead of broadly mentioning "technology," the revised prompt focuses on "artificial intelligence in healthcare."  
2. **Clear Scope** – It specifies key aspects to cover: benefits, challenges, and future potential.  
3. **Defined Length** – A 500-word limit provides clear expectations for depth and detail.  

This makes it easier for the writer to stay focused and ensures the final content aligns with the intended goal.
